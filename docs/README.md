<h3>The Idea behind RG-MX</h3>
<hr/>
As a Mendix Widget Developer, I work and Develop from a Mac, but as Mendix Studio currently is only available on Windows, I use Parallels as my Windows Client.

This means when I develop Widgets, I am switching between mac with Vscode, Windows for Mendix Studio, browser for Web View and when I develop Native Widgets the Android studio as well. When building Design Systems for Mendix I need to open deep nested folders to find the appropriate sass folders. As a developer who jumps constantly from one project to another I need to open and close multiple projects a day. This all leads to window-drown, where I have way to many windows open and that hurts my head and performance. I ideally I would like to close all I don't use and only have open only what I am working with.

The idea with the app is to be able to close a project and get back to it with a simple click of a button. This apps solves that.
