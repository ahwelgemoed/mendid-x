<h3>The Idea behind RG-MX</h3>
<hr/>
As a Mendix Widget Developer, I work and Develop from a Mac, but as Mendix Studio currently is only available on Windows, I use Parallels as my Windows Client.

This means when I develop Widgets, I am switching between mac with Vscode, Windows for Mendix Studio, browser for Web View and when I develop Native Widgets the Android studio as well. When building Design Systems for Mendix I need to open deep nested folders to find the appropriate sass folders. As a developer who jumps constantly from one project to another I need to open and close multiple projects a day. This all leads to window-drown, where I have way to many windows open and that hurts my head and performance. I ideally I would like to close all I don't use and only have open only what I am working with.

The idea with the app is to be able to close a project and get back to it with a simple click of a button. This apps solves that.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<hr/>
You install the app on your windows machine and the app on your macbook.

You point the Windows app to your Mendix folders and Copy the Windows Address.

You then go to the mac app and point it to your Mendix Apps Folders. In the Mac app you also add the windows address you added and point it to your widgets folder (if you use it), you also add your github username to get all your gists (again only if you use it).

This will then list out all projects you have. It then gives you the ability to open studio quickly, or Vscode ect.

<br/>
<h4>ðŸ›‘ Before You Start</h4>

For the App to work you will have some prior setup that need to be done.

- VSCode must be installed and added to your PATH ([macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)/[Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows#_installation))
- Parallels must be Setup according to Mendix Docs ([Mendix Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/mobile/using-mendix-studio-pro-on-a-mac))
- All Mendix projects must be in one folder (Nesting is not yet supported [see here](https://github.com/ahwelgemoed/rg-mx/projects/1#card-54876549))
- (Optional) Android Studio must be installed and Configured as Stated by React Native Team ([React Native Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#installing-dependencies))
- (Optional) All Widgets on Mac must be one folder

<h3>Technical Info</h3>
<hr/>

This is a Electron app, with a Socket IO Server. certain commands from the mac is passed to the socket server where the windows app listen as executes them.

Every 30 Seconde the Windows App Pings the Mendix projects.

Every 15 Mins the Windows app looks for more Projects in the Mendix Folder

Both apps `.dmg` and `.exe` are exactly the same.

On startup in the main process, the Operating system is detected and if its macOS it will Make a "Tray" app and if Windows it will make a "Browser" App. This is why both installs are relatively big, because the Mac app has a socket server that never gets used, and the Windows app has .apks it can never access. This was done to keep the project as simple as possible, as keeping it all together and separating functionality based on OS and Routes seemed very easy. It has led to some spaghetti code and was more of a headache than expected, I would not recommend anyone ever do it.
